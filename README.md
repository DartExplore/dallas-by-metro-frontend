# dallas-by-metro-frontend
This is the front end for the Dallas by Metro web application built with React for the UI and basic SASS for styling.
Our website introduces users to the DART train system, gives them ideas on what locations to visit, and a planner to discover new and exciting locations.
Live version to be hosted soon.

# Getting Started
Clone this repository and cd into the root of the project. Ensure you have Node version 14 or greater and execute *npx vite* in the command line to start a development server.
To auto-update SASS changes run the command *sass --watch style.scss style.css* where style.scss is the file you are currently editing.
